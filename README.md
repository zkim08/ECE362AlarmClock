# ECE362_AlarmClock
ECE 362 - Project : Alarm Clock made with STM32 and a crystal oscillator

This project is an embedded C project for ECE 362 (Microprocessor Systems and Interfacing) at Purdue University. The alarm clock displays real time and a menu screen that allows the user to set a time. When the alarm rings, a math question will pop up. Until the user answers the question correctly, the alarm clock will play the Jaws theme song. For a more awakening experience, the alarm clock changes sounds if the user answers the question incorrectly.
